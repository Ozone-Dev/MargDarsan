# Introduction to JAVA
Java is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. Java is known for its platform independence, which means that Java programs can run on various computer platforms with little or no modification.
